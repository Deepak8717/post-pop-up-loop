                <p><span>T</span>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite
                    sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even though most
                    people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them.
                    It seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the
                    slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than
                    respect. Iam convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship
                    grow is by showing respect.<br/><br/>I have come to the conclusion
                    that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect is
                    showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a
                    desire to show them how highly they are valued.</p>
